# Data Structures Library in C
This repository provides implementations of common data structures in C.

Data structures are designed to be generic, efficient, and reusable for various applications.

## Features

**Hash Table**
- Implements key-value storage with string keys and generic `void*` values.
- Uses separate chaining for collision resolution.
- Supports user-defined hash function.

**Linked List**
